Follow the instructions.

1. Build with command like below. First param is a path where the
   binary file locates, and second param is the command to run, and
   third param is output binary filename, and existence of fourth 
   param means disable dynamic argument.

     ./builder.sh /usr/bin "docker images" test 1    # dynamic argument disabled
     ./builder.sh /usr/bin "docker images" test 0    # dynamic argument disabled
     ./builder.sh /usr/bin "docker images" test      # dynamic argument enabled
     ./builder.sh /usr/bin "docker images" my_prog   # output filename will be my_prog
     ./builder.sh /usr/bin "docker images"           # by default, output filename is test
     ./builder.sh "docker images"                    # by default, path is /usr/bin

2. Test it works by running output binary like below.

     ./test

3. Rename and move the output file with sudo.

4. Enjoy using it.
